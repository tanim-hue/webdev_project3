             <p><strong>Reading books :</strong>I have been a reader since childhood, and books have always been my favorite escape. I love diving into both <em>fictional</em> and <em>non-fictional</em> worlds — from fantasy stories that spark imagination to self-development books that teach new perspectives. Reading helps me think critically and expand my vocabulary.</p>

             <img id="image-football" src="images/football.jpg" alt="playing photo" width="300">
             <p><strong>Playing Football :</strong>Football has been my go-to sport for energy and teamwork. I enjoy the thrill of competition, the strategy behind every pass, and the team spirit on the field. Whether I am playing casually with friends or watching a live match, football gives me motivation and balance from academic life.</p>

             <img id="image-coding" src="images/coding.jpg" alt="coding photo" width="300">
             <p><strong>Exploring coding projects :</strong>I have always been fascinated by technology and problem-solving. I love building small coding projects, experimenting with Python, and learning how the web works. Each new project helps me improve logic and creativity, and seeing my code come to life gives me a huge sense of accomplishment.</p>
